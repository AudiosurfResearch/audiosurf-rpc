# audiosurf-rpc
Discord Rich Presence for Audiosurf in the form of a DLL. No seperate program, DLL injector or any other stuff required.

# Installation
**Note:** This may get automated in the future to make installation even easier.

Download the latest version from the [releases page](https://github.com/RubberDuckShobe/audiosurf-rpc/releases).
Open the folder where ``Audiosurf.exe`` is located, then open the ``engine`` folder there, copy all the things from the release's .zip into there and allow Windows to overwrite the existing files.
All that's left to do is launch the game! If a command line window opens while the game is loading, that means you installed audiosurf-rpc correctly!
Have fun!
